## Project 2 - Ghost Tracker

### Jake Hanicak / 4-7-20 / Interaction Design

##### Ghost tracker allows you to communicate with the spirit relm utalizing your handy ESP32 and Arduino programming. For this project I crafted and utalized my past assignments and new modifications to create a platform where you could talk to ghosts. To get it to work do the following - 

1. There is two different interactions that may be done on this board. They are using the light sensor to "catch a ghost" and the button to "communicate with ghosts and to get their real responses"
2. For the sensor - it will constantly be blinking red in low light, perfect for spooky times. When something covers the sensor and it goes dark, it turns to green and that signifies that a ghost is present! However, no one should be hunting for ghosts in the daytime, so it will turn off in daylight and no light will show!
3. for the button - the button is a unique way to communicate with the spirits around you and to see there real response to your questions. All you do is ask a question out loud, wait for a second and then press the button and the light will turn on and the terminal will show the spirits response. (This is all done with arrays that have many many different iterations in them to give you a unique response each time.
4. enjoy yourself and go ghost hunting!
